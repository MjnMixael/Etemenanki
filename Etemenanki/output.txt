Still, I think it's an open secret that I may not have adhered 100% to the letter of every <span class='blue'>GTA</span> trade regulation, let's say. I hope you can understand why. Everything I've done in <span class='yellow'>Regulus</span> and <span class='yellow'>Sirius</span> was for the benefit of the common people. Hamid and I've got two little kids back home.

I think the past weeks have ground down the friction between our respective factions, and you'll be welcome.

That's why <span class='blue'>Charon</span> and me enlisted, you know?
